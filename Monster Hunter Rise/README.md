# Monster Hunter Rise

## Randomizer Rules and Victory

Goal: Find all of your quest rank stars, enough location unlocks, and enough weapons/armor to complete your victory quest.
- **Master Rank**: Complete The Devil's Reincarnation (MR 6*)
- **High Rank**: Complete The Allmother (7*)
- **Low Rank**: Complete Blue, Round, and Cute (4*)

Each weapon, armor, and talisman rarity tier is unlocked as an item. Each quest rank star is unlocked as an item, and each location is unlocked as an item.

In order to complete a quest, you must have enough stars for that quest and have enough location unlocks for that quest. You must find 2 copies of a location to complete a HR quest, and 3 copies to complete a MR quest. E.g. in order to complete the quest "Honing your Hammer", you must have 5 quest rank stars and 2 Sandy Plains unlocks. In order to complete "In Search of the Doctor", you must have 7 quest rank stars, 4 master rank stars, and 3 Jungle unlocks. 

**Master Rank only:** The allowed Dango are also shuffled into the pool. You need to unlock the Dango you are allowed to use. In the Low Rank and High Rank randomizers, you can use any Dango you like.
