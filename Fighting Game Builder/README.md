### Meta

### Game Modes

There are 2 types of game modes

#### `character-based`

These game modes are tied to unlocking specific characters, and then achieving victories with those characters

#### `score-based`

These game modes are usually independent of character, and rely instead on reaching some kind of high-score with any of the characters available to you.
